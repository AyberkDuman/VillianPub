# VillianPub

Here is my fun project, basicly social media for villains. Possible to create an account, share post and make connection with other villains.

Large majority of design cloned from twitter because of users habits. Also, I try new styling and color palette. All ui build with Bootstrap and fontAwesome.

In backend, i use php to manage user and post instructions *not complete yet. 

required php server to run, i used xampp.

there is a few screenshots below from my project.
